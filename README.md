# DECD Design System Component Library 🎨

This repository contains the source code for the React component library which corresponds to DECD designs following the [canada.ca guidelines](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/about/design-system.html).

This library contains reusable components that are accessible and can be used across DECD products in order to ensure brand and design consistency and to speed up development through reusability.

## Using this Package in Your Project 🤓

The package is hosted in github packages. To use it simply install it as one of your dependencies

First create a `.npmrc` file in the same directory as your `package.json` with the following content.

```text
@dts-stn:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

This specifies that any package scoped @dts-stn should come from the github npm registry (where this package is located).

Then install the package using this command

```bash
$ npm install --save @dts-stn/decd-design-system
```

You can then import the components you wish to use anywhere in your project

```js
import { Component } from "@dts-stn/decd-design-system";
```

## Developing this Package 👨🏽‍💻👩🏽‍💻

### Developing and Documenting Components 📝

This project uses storybook to document and provide a playground to visually see components in action. To run storybook, run the command below from the root directory

```bash
$ npm run storybook
```

### Building the Package 👷🏽‍♀️👷🏽

This package uses babel and rollup to transpile and create production bundles which are generated in the `/dist` folder at the root level of the project. To build the production bundle at any time simple run the following command

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Rollup looks at the following file [src/index.js](src/index.js) to determine what it should include in the production bundle... as such only import and export things in this file that you want to be included, otherwise do not touch this file.

### Testing Strategies 🧪

This project uses jest and the react testing library for testing. We've decided to use Jest as it is a widely used testing tool and provides sufficient resources for testing a component library. The React Testing Library provides useful helpers to further push the flexibility of the jest testing tool. Some example test cases include;

- Testing components with multiple styles (ex. button component with different button styles) [src/components/ActionButton.test.js](src/components/ActionButton.test.js)
- Components styles are correctly rendered (Dimensions, Color, Fontstyle, Fontsize, etc) line 12 [src/components/Banner.test.js](src/components/Banner.test.js)
- Clickable components (ex. button component has an onclick prop) line 17 [src/components/Menu.test.js](src/components/Menu.test.js)
- Rendering with different input props line 19 [src/components/TextField.test.js](src/components/TextField.testjs)

To run tests simply use the following command in the root directory

```bash
$ npm run test
```

### Accessibility Testing Strategies

**Important Note:** we are testing for WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliance: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ according to the Standard on Web Accessibility: https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601

We are using the Axe web browser extension as our main tool for accessibility testing. Axe provides stricter and clearer infomation in regards to accessibility issues, when compared to other web browser tools and is very easy to use. Axe is not ran through our code repo, it is an external tool which users need to download.

To download the Axe web browser extension, visit https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd.

Along with Axe we are also preforming QA to manually check for accessibility concerns and automated testing done by Jest-axe. Jest-axe is time efficient but only covers about 30% of unit test cases. We use multiple tools and steps to do accessibility testing, as no one tool is capable of checking for all instances accessibility concerns.

To use Axe:

- Go to the page you want to test and open your dev tools
- Select the "axe DevTools" tab
- Select one of the "Scan Page" options

After scanning user will be presented with a list of accessibility concerns and guidance on how to fix them.

Jest-axe is ran along with other unit tests. The following is an example test case;

- Passing the Action Button Props through jest-axe tool line 73 [src/components/ActionButton.test.js](src/components/ActionButton.test.js)

To run unit tests follow instructions listed under the [Testing Strategies 🧪](#Testing-Strategies-🧪) section.

For more information on tools and resources refer to our wiki page https://github.com/DTS-STN/DECD-Design-System/wiki#accessibility-documentation

### Browser & Device Testing

We will be building components for mobile first, but also supporting web browsers and all screen sizes.

Testing will be done manually, to confirm components are displaying correctly on different web browsers. Based on data collected, we will be supporting and testing on the following 3 most used browsers (Make sure to test on atleast one of the given versions listed under each web browser);

- Google Chrome
  - Version 80, 81, 85
- Safari
  - Version 12.1, 13, 13.1, 14
- Internet Explorer
  - Version 11

### Playground ⛹🏽‍♀️⛹🏽‍♂️

Sometimes it's helpful to see a component in an actual application being rendered in the browser. This project includes a create-react-app application with the decd-design-system package being installed via a symlink in the node modules thus simulating a client project. To run this project

First run rollup in watch mode

```bash
$ npm run build-watch
```

This will rebuild the bundle everytime you make a change to the package code.

You can then run the playground application in a separate shell.

Starting from the root directory, run the following commands in the order shown (**Reminder:** npm install if it's your first time using the playground)

```bash
$ cd playground && npm run start
```
